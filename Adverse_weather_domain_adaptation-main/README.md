# Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions using DETR

## Overview

This project explores a domain adaptation technique — **Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA)** — integrated with the **Detection Transformer (DETR)** architecture to perform robust object detection under challenging weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. Adverse weather environments significantly affect visibility and scene clarity, which limits the accuracy of traditional object detectors. This work demonstrates how FDA can help bridge the domain gap without retraining, making DETR more resilient for real-world deployment.

## Objectives

- Evaluate the baseline DETR model under clear and adverse weather conditions  
- Apply Fourier Domain Adaptation to reduce domain shift  
- Improve detection performance (mAP) under degraded visibility  

---

## System Design

- **FDA**: Swaps low-frequency components in the Fourier domain to align style/illumination of target images  
- **DETR**: Anchor-free transformer-based object detection framework with global attention  
- **Combined Pipeline**: FDA-preprocessed images are fed to a frozen DETR for detection  

---

## Specifications

- **Domain Adaptation**: Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA)  
- **Object Detector**: Detection Transformer (DETR) with ResNet-50 backbone  
- **Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Image Resolution**: 224x224  
- **Datasets**:  
  - DAWN (adverse weather images)  
  - BDD100K (diverse driving scenarios)  
- **Training Strategy**: Inference-only (no fine-tuning required)  
- **Outputs**: Bounding boxes and class labels

## Implementation Steps

1. **Fourier Transform**: Transform the source (adverse weather) and reference (clear weather) images to frequency domain  
2. **Amplitude Swapping**: Swap low-frequency components of adverse images with those from clear images  
3. **Inverse Transform**: Convert the adapted image back to spatial domain  
4. **Object Detection**: Feed the adapted image to the DETR model  
5. **Output**: Obtain and visualize predictions

## Results

### Baseline DETR
- **mAP@50**: 35.94%  
- **mAP**: 21.30%  

### FDA + DETR
- **mAP@50**: 38.45%  
- **mAP**: 23.49%  

FDA improved detection confidence and localization in adverse weather with no retraining of DETR. It also maintained consistent performance in clear conditions, demonstrating lightweight and robust adaptation.

## Key Findings

- FDA bridges the domain gap by aligning low-frequency features while preserving object structures  
- Works as a plug-and-play preprocessing step for any pre-trained detector  
- Lightweight, no expensive retraining required  
- Highly tunable with blending factors and frequency area size

## Future Scope

- Optimize FDA and DETR for real-time embedded applications  
- Handle complex weather scenarios (e.g., foggy night, extreme snowstorms)  
- Integrate end-to-end learnable adaptation instead of static FDA  
- Test on larger and more diverse datasets
